# Task 1: Build a temperature Conversion Program.

In this program, i am going to write a code for converting the units of measurement for temperature. For example, converting celsius to Kelvin or Fahrenheit and vice-a-versa.

## Technologies used: 

C++, Functions.

## Key learnings: 

While writing the program i was able to learn many new things like:
1. How the temperature conversion happens in different units.
2. The mathematical background of it.
3. Improve my coding knowledge.

# Task 2: Create a Guessing game.

In this program, i am going to write a code for building a number game where user have to guess the correct number.The number of guesses are tracked and finally on right guess the user can check how many rounds it took fo him to guess the right number.

## Technologies used: 

C++, game building.

## Key learnings: 

While writing the program i was able to learn many new things like:
1. Idea on how the interactive game play looks like.
2. The mathematical background of it.
3. Improve my coding knowledge.

# Task-3: Implement a Simple Contact Management System.

## Technologies used: 
C++, Libraries.

## Key learnings: 

While writing the program, I was able to learn many new things, such as:

1. File I/O Operations: Gained a solid understanding of how to perform file input and output operations, including reading from and writing to files using ifstream and ofstream. Also learned the importance of proper error handling when dealing with file operations.
2. Structured Data Management: Learned how to manage structured data using custom data types and collections. This included defining a struct to encapsulate contact information, using a vector to store multiple contacts, and understanding data encapsulation and access through various methods to manipulate the data.
3. User Interface and Interaction: Improved knowledge of creating a user interface in the console and handling user input effectively. This involved displaying a menu, processing user choices using a switch statement, and formatting output for better readability using the iomanip library.

# Task 5: Web Scraping.

In this task, I developed a web scraping program that extracts product information, such as names, prices, and ratings, from an online e-commerce website and stores the data in a structured format like a CSV file.

## Technologies used: 

Python, BeautifulSoup, requests, CSV

## Key learnings: 

While writing the program, I was able to learn many new things, such as:

1. Web Scraping Fundamentals: Gained a solid understanding of web scraping techniques and how to interact with web pages programmatically.
2. HTML Parsing: Learned how to parse and navigate HTML documents to extract specific data elements using BeautifulSoup.
3. HTTP Requests: Improved knowledge of making HTTP requests and handling responses using the requests library.
4. Data Storage: Learned how to structure and store extracted data in a CSV file for easy analysis and further use.
5. Ethical Considerations: Understood the importance of respecting website terms of service and ethical guidelines while scraping data.
